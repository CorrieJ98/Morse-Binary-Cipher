Just aiming for a .txt prototype at this stage but the conversion sequence should go as follows:

raw text > string

string > char

char > ascii decimal

ascii decimal > morse

morse > binary

binary > ascii hex

ascii hex > new .txt file

will this work? probably not

will it be secure? also probably not

will it be a fun project? yes.
